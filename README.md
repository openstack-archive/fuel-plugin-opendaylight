OpenDaylight Plugin for Fuel
================================

OpenDaylight plugin
-----------------------

Overview
--------

This is a proof of concept of the plugin which will install OpenDaylight controller and set it as manager for OVS using ovsdb plugin.

* [OpenDaylight controller](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Main) is a SDN controller.
* [OVSDB plugin](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OVSDB_Integration:Main) implement the Open vSwitch Database management protocol.

Requirements
------------

| Requirement                      | Version/Comment |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Mirantis OpenStack compatibility | 6.1             |

Recommendations
---------------

None.

Limitations
-----------

* Supports only environments with Neutron
* HA for ovsdb feature is not implemented in Lithium release - one instance of ODL controller runs on primary OpenStack controller.
* L3 traffic managed by neutron agent - lack of drivers in OpenStack Juno.

Installation Guide
==================

OpenDaylight plugin installation
----------------------------------------

1. Clone the fuel-plugin-opendaylight repo from stackforge:

        git clone https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-opendaylight

2. Install the Fuel Plugin Builder:

        pip install fuel-plugin-builder

3. Install the [fpm gem](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm):

        gem install fpm
    
4. Build OpenDaylight Fuel plugin:

        fpb --build fuel-plugin-opendaylight/

5. The *opendaylight-[x.x.x].rpm* plugin package will be created in the plugin folder.
  
6. Move this file to the Fuel Master node with secure copy (scp):

        scp opendaylight-[x.x.x].rpm root@<the_Fuel_Master_node_IP address>:/tmp

7. While logged in Fuel Master install the OpenDaylight plugin:

        fuel plugins --install opendaylight-[x.x.x].rpm

8. Check if the plugin was installed successfully:

        fuel plugins

        id | name         | version | package_version
        ---|--------------|---------|----------------
        1  | opendaylight | 0.5.2   | 2.0.0

9. Plugin is ready to use and can be enabled on the Settings tab of the Fuel web UI.

Build options
-------------

It is possible to modify process of building plugin by setting environment variables. Look into [pre_build_hook file](pre_build_hook) for more details.

Dependencies
------------

OpenDaylight controller require Java Runtime Environment.
If you plan to use plugin in environment without internet access or/and CentOS environment modify build command:

     INCLUDE_DEPENDENCIES=true fpb --build fuel-plugin-opendaylight/

Pre build script will try download required dependencies so it become part of the compiled plugin.

Note: List of packages for [ubuntu](odl_package/ubuntu/dependencies.txt) and [centos](odl_package/centos/dependencies.txt) may need to be modified if packages in centos or ubuntu repositories will change.

Testing
-------

Use the same IP address as for OpenStack Horizon panel and port 8181 to reach dlux web ui and apidoc explorer:

* DLUX: http://horizon_ip:8181/index.html
* APIDOC: http://horizon_ip:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html

OpenDaylight files are stored on primary controller inside */opt/opendaylight* directory.

To log in to OpenDayligt shell run */opt/opendaylight/bin/client*

Known issues
------------

* VM live migration not supported by ODL ovsdb
* ODL ignore MTU size from Neutron and create tap devices for VMs with MTU 1500. Things like Jumbo frames will not work on VMs side.

Release Notes
-------------

**0.5.2**

* Initial release of the plugin. This is a beta version.

**0.6.0**

* Integrate Lithium release with OpenStack Juno.

**0.6.1**

* Integrate Lithium SR1 with OpenStack Juno.
