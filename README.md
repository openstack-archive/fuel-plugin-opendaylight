OpenDaylight Plugin for Fuel
================================

OpenDaylight plugin
-----------------------

Overview
--------

This is a proof of concept of the plugin which will install OpenDaylight controller and set it as manager for OVS using ovsdb plugin.

* [OpenDaylight controller](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Main) is a SDN controller.
* [OVSDB plugin](https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OVSDB_Integration:Main) implement the Open vSwitch Database management protocol.

Requirements
------------

| Requirement                      | Version/Comment |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Mirantis OpenStack compatibility | 6.1             |

Recommendations
---------------

None.

Limitations
-----------

* Supports only environments with Neutron
* HA not implemented in Helium release - one instance of ODL controller runs on primary OpenStack controller.
* L3 traffic managed by neutron agent - L3 is not fully implemented in Helium release, lack of drivers in OpenStack Juno.
